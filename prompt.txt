I am creating a game which can be run in the browser.
This game is a 2D game, the idea of this game is as below:
1. This game will use Google map to show the real world.
2. There will be a plane flying above the map, players can use arrow key to control the flying direction.
3. The flying will be infinite, the plane will keep flying around the world if the player never exit the game.
4. There will be a default altitude for the plane, players can scroll the mouse to zoom in and out, while 
   zooming in, the map will display more details of the ground, the plane will also display more details 
   of itself.
5. The plane is a F15 fighter jet.
6. At the right bottom of the screen, there will be a radar keep scanning things.
7. A list of Latitude and longitude will be provided, once the plane fly near on of the location, players 
   can see a dot blinking on the radar, and also can hear a beep beep sound.
8. There will be a background sound like the sound in the fighter jet while playing the game.
